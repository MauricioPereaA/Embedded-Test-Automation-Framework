Builder
========

The builder module will store all needed classes and methods to allow DTAF to
build virtual representations of each device based on a `Model` file, this file
will be designed using the YAML structure to easen our device definition and
allow our abstrac classes and bases to automatically build a representation for
you to test.

please, see the documentation of each interface and the how to to learn more
about the viable configurations you may need to set in order for the VDR to
work.

Each interface, device will have their own set of configurations you may need or
want to change to accomodate the VDR into your test bench.
